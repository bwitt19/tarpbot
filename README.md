# tarpBot
#####Slack (channel analysis) bot using Slack API &amp; IBM Watson.
Currently: can connect to the Slack API and bring down text entered by users. Tone analysis and text eporting is coming in the near future.

- Built with Node.js.
- Modules (npm): express, body-parser

### Installation:
1. If not installed already, download the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your machine.
2. Clone this repository into the directory of your choosing. (Node.js program/project files live in their own directory.)
3. Open Terminal in Linux/Mac (or Windows PowerShell for Windows users) and type:
```
npm install 
// This will install all necessary modules for the program to work 
// (e.g. express, body-parser, and their dependencies)
```

To run the program, just type `node path/to/index` or `node index` if already in the directory.
At some point I'll make a bash script/.exe installer to expedite this process, but this should work for now.

If you have any comments/concerns/**bugs!!**, please let me know! :)
